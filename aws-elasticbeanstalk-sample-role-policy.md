## aws-elasticbeanstalk-sample-role IAM policy
The `aws-elasticbeanstalk-sample-role` role and policy is generated by the Elastic Beanstalk CLI during setup.  

If not using the CLI to create the Beanstalk environment, create an IAM EC2 service role with the following inline policy.  Attach the policy to the "IAM instance profile" virtual machine permissions section of the EB security configuration box.
